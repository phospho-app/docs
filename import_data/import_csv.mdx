# Format your csv file

Your CSV file need to have the following columns:

- `input` : the input text data, ususally the user message
- `output` : the output text, ususally the LLM app response

Additonally, you can add the following columns:

- `task_id`: an id of the task (input/output couple)
- `session_id`: an id of the session, tasks with the same session_id will be grouped together in a single session
- `created_at`: the creation date of the task (format it like `"2021-09-01 12:00:00"`)

The maximum upload size with this method is 500MB.
