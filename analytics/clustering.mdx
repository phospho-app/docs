title: Clustering
description: "Group users messages based on their intention"
---

Clustering lets your group user messages based on their intention. This is great to get a feeling of "what are my users talking about?" and to identify the most common topics.

## How it works

The phospho clustering uses a combination of **user intent embedding** and **unsupervized clustering algorithms** to group messages together.

The user intent embedding is a representation of the user intention in a high dimensional space. This representation is generated using a deep learning model trained on a large dataset of user messages. [Learn more here.](https://research.phospho.ai/phospho_intent_embed.pdf)

We are constantly evaluating and improving the clustering algorithms to provide the best results.

## How to use it

To use the clustering feature, you need to have a phospho account and an API key. You can get one by signing up on [phospho.ai](https://platform.phospho.ai).

1. If not already done, import your data and setup a payment method.
2. Then, go to the Clusters tab and click on the "Configure clustering detection" button.
3. Select the type of data you want to cluster: either complete sessions or individual messages.
4. You can filter the data you want to cluster by setting a date range, a specific tag, and more.
5. Click on the "Run clustering" button to start the clustering process. The process can take a few minutes depending on the size of your dataset.

## How to interpret the results

The clustering results are presented in two formats:

- **3D Dot Cloud Graph**: This visual representation shows the clustering in
  a three-dimensional space. Each point in the graph corresponds to a message
  (or a session), and clusters are depicted as distinct groupings of these
  points. Use this graph to get a high-level overview of how messages (or
  sessions) are grouped spatially.

- **Cluster Cards**: Each cluster is also displayed as a card below. The
  card shows the number of messages in the cluster and an automatic summary
  describing a random sample of messages in the cluster.
  Click on "Explore" in
  any card to view the detailed messages within that specific cluster. This will
  help you analyze the content and context of the messages grouped together.

## How to run a clustering with a custom instruction

By default, the clustering is run based on: <i> user intent </i>. You can modify this instruction in <i>Advanced settings</i>. Adjusting the clustering instruction can help refine how messages are grouped, providing insights that are more aligned with your needs.

## How to run a custom clustering algorithms?

You can use the user intent embeddings to run your own clustering algorithms. The embeddings are available through the API. [Learn more here.](/models/embeddings)

## Next steps

Based on the clusters, define more analytics to run on your data in order to never miss a beat on what your users are talking about. Check the [event detection page](/analytics/events) for more information.
