title: Clustering
description: "Group users messages based on their intention"
---

Clustering lets your group user messages based on their intention. This is great to get a feeling of "what are my users talking about?" and to identify the most common topics.

## How it works

The phospho clustering uses a combination of **user intent embedding** and **unsupervized clustering algorithms** to group messages together. 

The user intent embedding is a representation of the user intention in a high dimensional space. This representation is generated using a deep learning model trained on a large dataset of user messages. [Learn more here.](https://research.phospho.ai/phospho_intent_embed.pdf)

We are constantly evaluating and improving the clustering algorithms to provide the best results.

## How to use it

To use the clustering feature, you need to have a phospho account and an API key. You can get one by signing up on [phospho.ai](https://platform.phospho.ai). 

If not already done, import your data and setup a payment method. Then, go to the Clusters tab and click on the "Configure clustering detection" button.

You can filter the messages you want to cluster by setting a date range, a specific tag, and more.

Click on the "Run clustering" button to start the clustering process. The process can take a few minutes depending on the size of your dataset.

## How to interpret the results

The clustering results are displayed in a table where each row represents a cluster. The table shows the number of messages in the cluster and an automatic summary describing a random sample of messages in the cluster.

Click on a row to see the messages in the cluster.

## How to run custom clustering algorithms?

You can use the user intent embeddings to run your own clustering algorithms. The embeddings are available through the API. [Learn more here.](/models/embeddings)

## Next steps

Based on the clusters, define more analytics to run on your data in order to never miss a beat on what your users are talking about. Check the [event detection page](/analytics/events) for more information.
