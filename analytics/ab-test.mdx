AB testing lets you compare different versions of your app to see which one performs better.

## What is AB testing

AB testing is a method used to compare two versions of a product to determine which performs better. 

Comparing on a single criteria is hard, especially for LLM apps. Indeed, the performance of a product can be measured in many ways.

In phosho, the way AB testing is done is by comparing the **[analytics distribution](/guides/events) of two versions**: the candidate one and the control one.

## Prerequisites to run an AB test

You need to have setup [event detection](/guides/events) in your project. This will run analytics to measure the performance of your app: 

- **Tags:** eg. topic of the conversation
- **Scores:** eg. sentiment of the conversation (between 1 and 5)
- **Classifiers:** eg. user intent ("buy", "ask for help", "complain")

## Run an AB test from the platform

1. Click on the button "Create an AB test" on the phospho platform. If you want, customize the `version_id`, which is the name of the test. 

2. Send data to the platform [by using an SDK, an integration, a file, or more](/getting-started). All new incomming messages will be tagged with the `version_id`. 

## Alternative: Specify the `version_id` in your code

Alternatively, you can specify the `version_id` in your code. This will override the `version_id` set in the platform.

When logging to phospho, add a field `version_id` with the name of your version in `metadata`. See the example below:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
log = phospho.log(
    input="log this",
    output="and that",
    version_id="YOUR_VERSION_ID"
)
```

```javascript JavaScript
log = phospho.log({
  input: "log this",
  output: "and that",
  version_id:"YOUR_VERSION_ID",
});
```

```bash HTTP API
curl -X POST https://api.phospho.ai/v2/log/$PHOSPHO_PROJECT_ID \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $PHOSPHO_API_KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "batched_log_events": [
        {
            "input": "your_input",
            "output": "your_output"
            "metadata": {
                "version_id": "YOUR_VERSION_ID"
            }
        }
    ]
}'
```
</CodeGroup>

## Run offline tests

If you want to run offline tests, you can use the [phospho command line interface](/cli). Results of the offline tests are also available in the AB test tab.
