Use AB testing to compare different versions of your app and see which one performs better.

To get started, simply add a field `version_id` with the name of your version in the `metadata` when logging to phospho.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
log = phospho.log(
    input="log this",
    output="and that",
    version_id="YOUR_VERSION_ID"
)
```

```javascript JavaScript
log = phospho.log({
  input: "log this",
  output: "and that",
  version_id:"YOUR_VERSION_ID",
});
```

```bash HTTP API
curl -X POST https://api.phospho.ai/v2/log/$PHOSPHO_PROJECT_ID \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $PHOSPHO_API_KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "batched_log_events": [
        {
            "input": "your_input",
            "output": "your_output"
            "metadata": {
                "version_id": "YOUR_VERSION_ID"
            }
        }
    ]
}'

```

</CodeGroup>

Using this version_id, you will be able to compare the [average success rate](/guides/evaluation) of the different versions. 

Note that the difference in success rate must be statistically significant to be considered as a real difference. That's why phospho also computes the standard deviation.
