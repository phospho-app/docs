title: Quickstart
description: Run evaluations and detect events in your messages in minutes.
---

You can use the phospho lab locally to extract evaluations and events from your messages.

You will need ot install the phospho package with the `lab` extra:

```
pip install "phospho[lab]"
```

You need to set youOPENAI_API_KEY as an environment variable.

```
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

Then you can use the phospho lab to run extractions on your messages (for instance just using openai)

```python
from phospho import lab

# Create the phospho workload
workload = lab.Workload()

# Define the job configurations
class EventConfig(lab.JobConfig):
    event_name: str
    event_description: str

# Let's add an event detection task to our workload
workload.add_job(
            lab.Job(
                id="question_answering",
                job_function=lab.job_library.event_detection,
                config=EventConfig(
                    event_name="question_answering",
                    event_description="The user asks a question to the assistant",
                ),
            )
        )

# Let's add some messages to analyze
message = lab.Message(
                    id="my_message_id",
                    role="User",
                    content="What is the weather today in Paris?",
                )

# Run the workload on the message
await workload.async_run(
            messages=[message],
            executor_type="sequential",
        )

# Check the results of the workload
message_results = workload.results["my_message_id"]

print(f"Result of the event detection: {message_results['question_answering'].value}")
```
