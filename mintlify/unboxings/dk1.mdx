In this guide, we will unbox and setup the phospho Junior dev kit available [here](https://robots.phospho.ai).

<Info>phospho dev kits are shipped with EU plugs, so you might need an adapter.</Info>

# Attach the SO-100 arm

Find a table and fix the SO-100 robot arm using the 2 table clamps in the kit (see image below). Make sure the arm is well fixed and won't move.

# Plug everything together

In this order:
- Plug the SO-100 to the power supply using the black 12V power supply.
- Plug the USB-C cable to the SO-100 and to one of the 4 control module front USB port (use the USB-C to USB adapter in the kit).
- Plug the camera to one of the 4 control module front USB port.
- Plug the control module (with the Raspberry Pi) to the power supply (this goes into the USB-C port on the side).

Below is a pic of the setup you should have at this point.

# Connect your control module to your wifi

The LED on the control module should blink green. The control module will generate a wifi network called `phosphobot` with password `phosphobot123`.
Connect to the `phosphobot` network from a computer or phone. In your browser, go to [phosphobot.local](http://phosphobot.local). 
This is the dashboard to control and setup your control module.

Go to `Network Management`. Enter the Network Name and Password of your wifi network (be careful the Network Name should be exactly as seen on your device/router).

The control module will connect to your wifi network. If the connection is successful, the LED should be solid green.
If it fails, restart the control module using the button next to the led or unplug/replug it. Start over this section.

Connect your computer back to your wifi network (the one you entered in the control module). You should be able to access the control module dashboard at `phosphobot.local`.

# Send your first command

<Warning>Make sure the robot is well fixed and that the area around it is clear before sending any command.</Warning>

Go to the interactive API docs of the control module at [phosphobot.local/docs](http://phosphobot.local/docs). You can now send your first command to the robot.
Trigger the `/move/init` endpoint to initialize the robot (click `Try it out` and then `Execute`). Be careful, the robot will move.

# What's next?

- Explore the rest of the documentation and try out the example scripts.
- Send us a pic of your setup on Discord (join it [here](https://discord.gg/cbkggY6NSK)) ðŸ’š

## Automatic updates

Every time the control module is powered on, it will check for updates and install them automatically.

## Bugs and issues

If you encounter any issues, check that the control module is up do date (reboot it to make sure it is). 
If the issue persists, please report them on the phospho Discord server (join it [here](https://discord.gg/cbkggY6NSK)).
