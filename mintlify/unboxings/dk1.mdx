In this guide, we will unbox and set up the phospho Junior dev kit [available here](https://robots.phospho.ai).

## What's in the box?

<Info>Phospho dev kits come with EU power plugs.</Info>

- **Robot arm**
    - 1x SO-100 robot arm 
    - 1x 12V power source (for the arm)
    - 1x USB-C to USB-C cable
    - 1x USB-C to USB adapter
    - 2x Table clamps
- **Camera**
    - 1x Stereoscopic camera
    - 1x USB-C to USB cable
    - 1x Camera stand
- **Control module**
    - 1x Control module
    - 1x Raspberry Pi USB-C power supply
    - 1x Micro SD card adapter

## 1. Attach the SO-100 arm

Find a table and fix the SO-100 robot arm using the 2 table clamps in the kit (see image below). 

<Warning>Make sure the arm is securely fastened and won't move. Clear away any clutter that could get in the way of the arm's movement.</Warning>

## 2. Plug everything together

In this order:

1. Plug the _SO-100 robot arm_ into the power supply using the **black** 12V power supply.
2. Plug one end of the **USB-C cable** into the _SO-100 robot arm_ and the other into any **front USB port** on the **control module** (use the USB-C to USB **adapter** in the kit).
3. Attach the **stereoscopic camera** to the **camera stand** and place it next to the robot arm.
4. Plug the **stereoscopic camera** into one of the control module **front USB ports**. 
5. Plug the **control module** into the **white** power supply (this goes into the **USB-C port on the side of the control module**).

## 3. Connect your control module to your home WiFi

After plugging in the control module, look at the LED indicator: it should blink **four times quickly** and then pause. This means it is in **hotspot** mode (ready for setup).

Now, let's connect the control module to your home WiFi so it can communicate with your devices.

### Connect to the control module hotspot

Using your computer or phone, connect to the control module's WiFi network:
- Open the WiFi settings on your device
- Look for a network called `phosphobot` in your WiFi list and connect to it.
- Enter the password: `phosphobot123`.

### Access the control module dashboard

In your browser, go to [phosphobot.local](http://phosphobot.local). This is the **dashboard** to control and set up your control module.

_On Android, we recommend using the Chrome browser._

### Connect to your home WiFi

1. On `phosphobot.local`, go to `Network Management`. Enter the **network name** (WiFi SSID) and **password** of your WiFi network. 

<Warning>
The network name is cAsE sEnSiTiVe and should be exactly as seen on your device/router. Double-check for typos.
</Warning>

2. The control module will now connect to your WiFi network. If the connection is successful, the LED becomes **solid green.**

<Info>
If the LED **blinks slowly** (1-second intervals), it means the connection failed. Try these steps:
- Restart the control module by long-pressing the button next to the LED.
- Reconnect to the `phosphobot` WiFi network and try again.
</Info>

3. Connect your computer back to your home WiFi network (the one you entered in the dashboard). 

4. Reload the page [phosphobot.local](http://phosphobot.local) to access the control module dashboard. 

5. You're done! Click on "Make robot say hello" to test the connection. Everything works? Great! You're ready to send your first commands.

If this fails, restart the control module by long-pressing the button next to the LED. Then, start over this section.

Using the **BTBerryWiFi** app, you can use Bluetooth to connect the control module to your home WiFi. 

_Special thanks to its creator Norm Frenette for this awesome app!_

### Step 1: Download the BTBerryWiFi app

Download the _BTBerryWiFi_ app for your smartphone:

- on **iPhone,** [download the app from the AppStore.](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/btberrywifi/id1596978011)
- on **Android,** [download the app here.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12l5lCZS4T8wHfdSLyCGM-hrzh64EM-zo?usp=sharing) Install it with sideloading. _Note: the free version of the Android app only works for 7 days._

### Step 2: Reboot the control module

1. Long press the _power button_ of the control module until the LED turns red.
2. Press the _power button_ again and keep it pressed until the LED turns green.
3. Wait for the control module to boot up. When the LED blinks green slowly and regularly, your control module is ready for pairing.

<Warning>
Make sure no device is connected to the control module through WiFi.
</Warning>

### Step 3: Connect to WiFi with BTBerryWiFi

<Info>For reference, here's the link to the [full user guide](https://www.btberrywifi.com/).</Info>

1. Launch **BTBerryWiFi.** Accept the authorization request to use Bluetooth. Click on the button "Scan for Raspberry Pi".

2. Wait for _phosphobot_ to show up in the list below, then select it. 

<Note>Sometimes, you can see _no_name_ instead of _phosphobot_ in the list. If so, select _no name_ and carry on.</Note>

![Select phosphobot](/assets/rpi-1.png)

If no device shows up: close the app, turn Bluetooth off and on on your smartphone, and reboot the control module. Then start again.

3. Wait for your smartphone to pair with the control module, then for the WiFi access points to appear. This can take up to a minute.

![Wait for connection](/assets/rpi-2.png)

If you stay stuck on this screen for longer than 2 minutes, close the app, turn Bluetooth off and on on your smartphone, and reboot the control module. Then start again.

4. Select your home WiFi in the list. Then, enter the WiFi password. This will connect the control module to the WiFi network.

![Select a WiFi network](/assets/rpi-3.png)

Then enter the WiFi password and press connect.

<Note>This step may fail if you're trying to connect to a WiFi hotspot. If this happens to you, learn how to flash your own SD card [using this guide.](https://phospho-ai.notion.site/How-to-setup-the-Raspberry-Pi-with-phospho-teleop-server-1848ca0b4c0480c28281eadb5d1245ee?pvs=4)</Note>

5. The control module is now connected to WiFi. Access the control module dashboard on the URL [phosphobot.local](http://phosphobot.local). 

6. You're done! Click on "Make robot say hello" to test the connection. Everything works? Great! You're ready to send your first commands.

</Accordion>

## 4. Send your first commands

When your control module is connected to your home WiFi, you can now send your first command to the robot arm.

<Warning>Make sure the robot is well fixed and the area around is clear before sending any command.</Warning>

1. Go to the interactive API docs of the control module at [phosphobot.local/docs](http://phosphobot.local/docs). This page lets you send commands to the robot arm.

2. Trigger the `/move/init` endpoint to initialize the robot (click `Try it out` and then press `Execute`).

3. Your robot arm moves to the default position. _It's alive!_ ðŸŽ‰

4. Now, you can call the `/move/absolute` endpoint to move the robot to a specific position. The distances are in centimeters, and the angles in degrees.

## 5. Set up your Meta Quest App
The phospho dev kit is delivered with a [Meta Quest](https://www.meta.com/fr/quest/quest-3/?srsltid=AfmBOoqPSrSx_ABUZwNg30PYExXeJ_mTx3yyaK6Y_juZif_BlfcdpTjw) app for teleoperation. In this section, we will set up the app on your Meta Quest headset.

1. After purchasing your phospho dev kit, youâ€™ll receive an **email invitation** to the Meta Alpha program of the phospho teleop app. Follow the email instructions to link your Meta account to the Alpha program.

2. Make sure your **Meta Quest headset** is **turned on** and **connected to WiFi**. Once youâ€™ve linked your account, the Meta Quest will automatically download the app. This can take a moment.

<Info>The Meta Quest connects to the Teleoperation server through a shared WiFi connection. </Info>

3. Open the phospho teleop app from the library. Once downloading is done, you can open the software library on the Meta Quest. In the list of All apps, youâ€™ll see the *phospho teleop* app. This app is automatically updated with the latest releases.
