## Overview

This WebSocket endpoint allows real-time teleoperation of a robot arm. The connection enables high-frequency command and status updates to ensure precise control and immediate feedback.

## Data Flow

**Incoming Data**: The client sends JSON-formatted control data for the robot's movement.  
**Outgoing Data**: The server sends JSON-formatted status updates, including the number of actions received and the current gripped status of the object.


## Control Data

The client sends control data in JSON format, which includes the following fields:


```json
{
  "x": 0.5,
  "y": 1.2,
  "z": -0.7,
  "rx": 45.0,
  "ry": 30.0,
  "rz": 90.0,
  "open": 1,
  "source": "left" // or "right"
}
```

See the [Teleoperation control endpoint](/control/move-teleoperation) endpoint for more details on each field.

## Status Updates

Status updates are sent back to the client every second or when there is a change in the gripped status of the object.


```json
{
  "nb_actions_received": 5,
  "is_object_gripped": false,
  "is_object_gripped_source": "left"
}
```



## Error Handling

If the received data cannot be decoded as JSON, an error message is sent back to the client:

```json
{
  "error": "JSON decode error: <error details>"
}
```
