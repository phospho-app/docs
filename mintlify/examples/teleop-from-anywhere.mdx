Control your robot from anywhere in the world using ngrok. 

This guide will walk you through the steps to securely allow people to control your robot over the internet.


## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:

1. A **control module** set up, connected to the internet, and running with the phosphobot server. [Learn how to set up your control module](/unboxings/dk1).
2. An ngrok account. [Sign up here](https://ngrok.com/) if you don’t have one. Alternative: Cloudflare Tunnel.
3. The ngrok CLI installed on your machine. [Download it here](https://ngrok.com/download).

## 1. Install and Authenticate ngrok

1. **Download ngrok**: If you haven’t already, download and install the ngrok CLI from the [official website](https://ngrok.com/download).
2. **Authenticate ngrok**: Open a terminal and run the following command to link your ngrok account:

   ```bash
   ngrok authtoken YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
   ```

   Replace `YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN` with the token provided in your ngrok dashboard.


## 2. Tunnel Your Local Server

1. Turn on your control module to run the phosphobot server.

2. SSH into your phosphobot. By default, the password is `password123`

```bash
ssh phosphobot@phosphobot.local
```

3. Run the following command to create a tunnel:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 80
   ```

   This command tells ngrok to forward traffic from the internet to your local server running on port 80.

4. Once the tunnel is active, ngrok will display a forwarding URL in the terminal. It will look something like this:

   ```
   Forwarding  https://abc123.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:80
   ```

   This URL is now publicly accessible from anywhere in the world. It will remain active while the ngrok tunnel is running. Turn off the control module to stop the tunnel.

## 3. Access Your Teleoperation App Remotely

1. Copy the `https://` URL provided by ngrok (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok.io`).
2. Share this URL with anyone who needs to access your teleoperation app.
3. Open the URL in a browser to access the Admin panel.
4. In the Meta Quest app, connect to the server using the ngrok URL in the **Settings** window.

<Note>Ensure your local server remains running while the ngrok tunnel is active. Closing the server will break the connection.</Note>


## 4. Secure Your Tunnel (Optional)

<Warning>By default, anyone with the URL control your robot and access the datasets. Secure the endpoint to restrict access.</Warning>


By default, ngrok tunnels are public. If you want to restrict access:

1. Add basic authentication to your tunnel by running:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 80 --auth "username:password"
   ```

   Replace `username` and `password` with your desired credentials.

2. Alternatively, you can restrict access to specific IP addresses using ngrok’s IP restrictions feature in the dashboard.


## 5. Monitor Traffic (Optional)

Ngrok provides a web interface to monitor traffic and inspect requests:

1. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:4040`.
2. Here, you can see detailed logs of incoming requests and responses.


## What’s Next?

Now that your teleoperation app is accessible remotely, you can:

- Share the ngrok URL with collaborators for real-time teleoperation.
- Record datasets remotely and upload them to your Hugging Face account.
- Train AI models using the data collected from remote sessions.
