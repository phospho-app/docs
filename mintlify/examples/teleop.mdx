## Prerequisites
Connect to the junior dev kit through Wifi in the phospho Meta Quest app.

<Info>Make sure you have already completed the [Installation Guide](/unboxings/dk1#5-set-up-your-meta-quest-app) and that you have a [MetaQuest](https://www.meta.com/fr/quest/quest-3/?srsltid=AfmBOorMLUmJKFQr35ssCi1DDqSNgpHk0sLHqo_tHG8kgclCYbMToAPa)</Info>

2. After connecting, you should see the main camera feed if a camera is connected. 
    - Move the windows with the `Grip Button` to organize your space.  
    - Press the `A` button once to start teleoperation and begin moving your controller. The robot will naturally follow the movement of your controller. Press the `Trigger Button` close the gripper.
    - Press the `A` button again to stop the teleoperation; the robot will stop.  

3. Start recording by pressing the `B` button. You can leave the default settings for your first attempt.  
    - Press the `B` button again to stop the recording.
    - Discard the recording by pressing the `Y` button. (left controller)  

4. Continue teleoperating and stop the recording when you're done.  

5. The recording is automatically saved in **LeRobot** format and uploaded to your HuggingFace account. Check it in your profile.  

## Chess

The phospho Meta Quest app let's you operate the robot arm in real time. The stereo camera system lets you see the robot's environment in 3D. 

Move freely as if you were there.
