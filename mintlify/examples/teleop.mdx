## Prerequisites
Connect to the junior dev kit through WiFi in the phospho Meta Quest app.

<Info>Make sure you have already completed the [Installation Guide](/unboxings/dk1#5-set-up-your-meta-quest-app) and that you have a [Meta Quest](https://www.meta.com/fr/quest/quest-3/?srsltid=AfmBOorMLUmJKFQr35ssCi1DDqSNgpHk0sLHqo_tHG8kgclCYbMToAPa)</Info>

1. Open the application. You should see a screen displaying **phosphobot** along with the server ping. Click the **Connect** butto using the `Trigger Button`.  

<Note>Make sure you're connected to the same WiFi as the control module.</Note>

2. After connecting, you should see the main camera feed if a camera is connected. Move the windows with the `Grip button` to organize your space.  
3. Press `A` once to start teleoperation and begin moving your controller.  
   - The robot will naturally follow the movement of your controller. Press the `Trigger button` to close the gripper.
   - Press `A` again to stop the teleoperation. The robot will stop.  

4. Press `B` to start recording. You can leave the default settings for your first attempt.  
   - Press `B` again to stop the recording.
   - Press `Y` (left controller) to discard the recording.

5. Continue teleoperating and stop the recording when you're done.  

6. The recording is automatically saved in **LeRobot** format and uploaded to your HuggingFace account. Check it in your profile.  

## Chess

The phospho Meta Quest app lets you operate the robot arm in real time. With the built-in stereo camera system, you can see the robot's environment in 3D, allowing you to interact as if you were physically present.
