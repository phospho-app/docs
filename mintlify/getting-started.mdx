## 1. Signing up

Go to the [phospho platform](https://platform.phospho.ai/). Login or create an account if you don't have one.

We recommend you use your company email address to create an account. This will let you easily invite your team members to collaborate on the same project.

## 2. Import your first messages

There are [several ways](./import-data/import-file.mdx) to import your data to phospho. The easiest is to upload a file. Let's see how to do it.

### Format your file

Format your `.csv` or `.xlsx` file to have the following columns:

- `input` : the input text data, ususally the user message
- `output` : the output text, ususally the LLM app response

Additonally, you can add the following columns:

- `task_id`: an id of the task (input/output couple)
- `session_id`: an id of the session. Messages with the same session_id will be grouped together
- `user_id`: the id of the user that sent the message
- `created_at`: the creation date of the task (format it like `"2021-09-01 12:00:00"`)
- other columns will be stored as _metadata_ and can be used for filtering

The maximum upload size with this method is 500MB.

### Upload the file to the plateform

Click the setting icon at the top right of the screen and select `Import data`.

Then, click the **Upload dataset** button and use **Choose file** button to select your file. After selecting the file, click on the **Send file** button.

Your file will be uploaded and processed in a few minutes, depending on the size of the file.

## 3. Run your first clustering

<Note>
  You need to have a **payment method** set up to run a clustering. Add a
  payment method in Settings and claim your free credits.
</Note>

Now that you imported data, you can run your first clustering.

Go to the **Clusters** page by clicking on **Clusters** on the sidebar.

On top, click on the `Configure clusters detection`button. Change the parameters if needed. Finally, click on the `Run cluster analysis` button.

The clustering will take some time to run. When it's finished, you'll see the results on the page.

Deep dive into the clusters or try different parameters to get different results.

### Tips

<Info>Running a clustering costs 2 credits per message.</Info>

- Click on a cluster to see the messages inside.
- Click on the pickaxe icon to breakdown a cluster into smaller clusters.
- Try different parameters (filters, scope, user query) to get different results.
