The phospho Junior dev kit is a set of tools to kickstart your journey in next-gen AI models, with built-in remote control.

## Exit the simulation. Train real-life AI robotics models.

Get started with the next level of robotics models: Diffusion transformers, OpenVLA, Cogact...

```python
import requests

# Control Junior's arm through API calls
requests.post(
	"http://localhost:80/move/absolute", 
	body={
		"x": 0, "y": 1, "z": 0,                   # Move left
		"rx": 10, "ry": 0, "rz": 0,               # Rotate
		"open": 1                                 # Open gripper
	}
)
```
