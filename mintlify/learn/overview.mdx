## What is a robot made up of?

Your robot is made up of a few key components:
- **Links**: The rigid plastic parts of the robot that are connected by joints.
- **Joints/Actuators**: The motors of the robot that allow the links to move relative to each other.
- **End effector**: The last part of the robot that interacts with the environment. i.e. gripper
- **Sensors**: The robot's eyes and ears. They allow the robot to perceive the world around it.
- **Controller**: The robot's brain. It processes the sensor data and sends commands to the actuators.

The hard part is making sure all these components work together to achieve a goal.
How do you make the robot move to a specific position? How do you make it pick up an object?

## What is a policy ?

A policy is a function that maps the current state of the robot to an action. It tells the robot what to do in a given situation.

For example, a policy for a robot vacuum cleaner might be:
- If the robot detects dirt, move towards it.
- If the robot detects a wall, turn left.

The policy is what allows the robot to make decisions and take actions based on its environment.
