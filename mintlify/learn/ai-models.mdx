## What is LeRobot?

LeRobot is a platform designed to facilitate access to real-world robotics by providing models, datasets, and tools in PyTorch, to make robotics more accessible for everyone. 

It focuses on state-of-the-art approaches in imitation learning and reinforcement learning, offering pretrained models, human-collected demonstration datasets, and simulated environments.

## Guide

If you haven't done so yet, check out our [Quickstart Guide](quickstart/record-upload-train) to record, upload, and train a model.

To train your AI model, you need to install phosphobot and LeRobot in your device:
```bash
pip install --upgrade phosphobot
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot.git
cd lerobot
pip install -e .  # Requires Python 3.10+
```

(Optional) If you want to use Weights & Biases for tracking training metrics, log in with:  

```bash
wandb login
```

Finally, launch the training script with the following command in the `lerobot` repository (change the device to `cuda` if you have an NVIDIA GPU or `cpu` if you donâ€™t have a GPU).  
Ensure that your `lerobot` virtual environment is activated.  

```bash
sudo python lerobot/scripts/train.py \
    --dataset.repo_id=<HF_USERNAME>/<DATASET_NAME> \
    --policy.type=<act or diffusion or tdmpc or vqbet> \
    --output_dir=outputs/train/phoshobot_test \
    --job_name=phosphobot_test \
    --device=mps \
    --wandb.enable=true
```

You will find your trained model in `lerobot/outputs/train/`.
