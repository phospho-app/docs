## What is LeRobot?

LeRobot is a platform designed to facilitate access to real-world robotics by providing models, datasets, and tools in PyTorch, to make robotics more accessible for everyone. 

It focuses on state-of-the-art approaches in imitation learning and reinforcement learning, offering pretrained models, human-collected demonstration datasets, and simulated environments.
