The phospho dev kit makes it easy to train robotics AI models with **LeRobot** from Hugging Face.

## What is LeRobot?

LeRobot is a platform designed to make real-world robotics more accessible for everyone. It provides pre-trained models, datasets, and tools in PyTorch.

It focuses on state-of-the-art approaches in **imitation learning** and **reinforcement learning**. 

With LeRobot, you get access to:
- Pretrained models for robotics applications
- Human-collected demonstration datasets
- Simulated environments to test and refine AI models

## Step by step guide

In this guide, we will use the phospho Junior dev kit to record a dataset and upload it to Hugging Face.  

<Note>Before starting, make sure you have already completed the [Installation Guide](/unboxings/dk1).</Note>  

## Prerequisites  

- A **Hugging Face account** to automatically upload your dataset (Sign up [here](https://huggingface.co/join) if you don't have one)
- A **device for training your model**. We recommend using a **GPU** for faster training.  
- The **control module powered on** and connected to the **robot arm** and **camera**.  
<Info>The phospho teleo app requires a **Meta Quest 2, Pro, 3 or 3s** to run</Info>  

## 1. Set up your Hugging Face token  
*To upload datasets, you need a Hugging Face token with write access. Follow these steps to generate one:*

1. Log in to your Hugging Face account
2. Go to **Profile** and click **Access Tokens** in the sidebar.  

3. Select the **Write** option to grant write access to your account. This is necessary for creating new datasets and uploading files. Name your token and click **Create token**.

4. **Copy the token** and **save it** in a secure place. You will need it later.  

5. Open a browser and access `phosphobot.local:80/admin` to access the control module server. 

6. **Paste the Hugging Face token**, and **save it**.

## 2. Start teleoperation and recording  

1. Download the **phospho teleop** app from the **Meta Quest Store**.  

2. Open the app. You should see a screen displaying **phoshobot** along with the server ping. Click **Connect**.  
<Warning>Ensure that you are connected to the same network as the control module.</Warning>

3. Upon connecting, you should see the main camera feed if a camera is connected. You can move various assets in the metaverse as needed.  

4. - Press `A` **once** to **start teleoperation** and begin moving your controller.  
   - Press `A` **again** to **stop teleoperation**. The robot will stop.  

5. - Press `B` to **start recording**. You can leave the default settings for your first attempt.  
   - Press `B` again to **stop the recording**.  

6. Continue teleoperating and stop the recording when you're done.  

7. The recording is automatically saved in **LeRobot** format and uploaded to your Hugging Face account. You can check it in your profile.  

## 3. Train your first model  

1. On the device where you want to run the training, install the [Phosphobot package](https://github.com/phospho-app/phosphobot):  

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade phosphobot
   ```

2. Clone the [LeRobot repository](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot) and install it:  

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot.git
   cd lerobot
   pip install -e .  # Requires Python 3.10+
   ```

3. *(Optional)* If you want to use **Weights & Biases** for tracking training metrics, log in with:  

   ```bash
   wandb login
   ```

4. Run the training script with the following command in the `lerobot` repository (Set --device=mps for Apple Silicon (Mac M1/M2), `cuda` if you have an NVIDIA GPU or `cpu` if you donâ€™t have a GPU). Ensure that your `lerobot` virtual environment is activated.  

   ```bash
   sudo python lerobot/scripts/train.py \
     --dataset.repo_id=<HF_USERNAME>/<DATASET_NAME> \
     --policy.type=<act or diffusion or tdmpc or vqbet> \
     --output_dir=outputs/train/phoshobot_test \
     --job_name=phosphobot_test \
     --device=mps \
     --wandb.enable=true
   ```

5. Your trained model will be saved in `lerobot/outputs/train/`.

### Automatic updates  

Every time the control module is powered on, it will check for updates and install them automatically. Updates will be available the next time you power it on.  

### Support  

Weâ€™re constantly rolling out updates to improve your experience, add new features, and fix issues.  

If you encounter any issues, first **reboot the control module** to ensure it is up to date. *The version ID is displayed on the dashboard.*  

If the issue persists, [reach out to us on our Discord](https://discord.gg/cbkggY6NSK). Our team of engineers is here to help!
