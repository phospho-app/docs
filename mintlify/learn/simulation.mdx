description: "List of simulation backends for robotics and AI research."
---

Simulation let you test models in virtual spaces without physical prototypes. They mimic real-world physics while staying efficient. 

Note that **no simulation prevents the need for real-world testing.** Real world properties like materials, sensor noise, human interaction, and more can't be fully replicated. Simulations themselves can have bugs or inaccuracies that affect results.

Simulations are here to help you iterate faster, expand your mathematical toolkit, and reduce the risk of damaging hardware.

# Trade-offs when choosing a simulation backend

- Simple tools are easy to use, but don't offer the same level of realism. They are also less extensible.
- More realistic simulations need more computing power, which can be slow or expensive. They are usually more difficult to setup and can be overkill for simple tasks.
- Open-source options are flexible and community-driven, while proprietary ones might be more polished but costly and hardware-specific. 

The right choice depends on your needs and resources.
