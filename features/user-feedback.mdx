title: User Feedback
description: 'Create something your users want'

In your app, you likely collects feedback from the user, in the form of rating of free text.

This feedback can be logged so it is displayed in the webapp.

## Note down task_id

In your app, you likely collect user feedback **after** having logged a task to phospho. To link the user feedback to the log, phospho need to know the **task_id**. 

phospho keeps tracks of the latest task id used. For simple use cases, you can do:

```python
phospho.user_feedback(
    task_id=phospho.latest_task_id, raw_flag="success", notes="Some notes (can be None)"
)
```

For more complex use cases, you can get the task_id from the `phospho.log`

```python
logged_content = phospho.log(input="question", output="answer")
task_id = logged_content["task_id"]

# ... later, when you collect feedback

phospho.user_feedback(
    task_id=task_id, raw_flag="success", notes="Some notes (can be None)"
)
```

You can also entirely manage the task_id yourself. 

```python
#Â Generate a new task_id
task_id = phospho.new_task_id()

# Pass it to phospho.log to create a task with this id
phospho.log(input="question", output="answer", task_id=task_id)

# Give user feedback
phospho.user_feedback(
    task_id=task_id, raw_flag="success", notes="Some notes (can be None)"
)
```

### API endpoint

If you have a more custom setup, log the user feedback to phospho using the "Update task" endpoint in the [API](/api). 

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.phospho.ai/v0/tasks/$TASK_ID/ \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $PHOSPHO_API_KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{

    "flag": "success",
    "flag_source": "user"
    "metadata": {"stuff": "more stuff"}
    "notes": "This is what the user said about this task"
}'
```

Pass `"flag": "success"` or `"flag": "failure"` to the app.
