## What are events in phospho?

Every task logged to phospho goes through an analytics pipeline. In this pipeline, phospho looks for **events** that you defined in your project settings.

By default, phospho will look for the following events:

- _question_answering_: The user asks a question
- _thanks_: The user thanks the assistant.
- _toxic_behavior_: The assistant is being toxic to the user.

For example, create custom events to discover key talking points in a conversation.

You can attach a webhook to an event, to be notified everytime the event is detected.

### Example of events

phospho enables you to detect custom events in your app. Here are examples of events:

- The user is trying to book a flight
- The assistant responded something that could be considered financial advice
- The assistant started with 'As an AI language model'
- The user uses slang that the LLM didn't understand
- The user thanked the agent for its help

## Define events

Events help you define and discover user behaviour on your conversational app. You are the one that define what events you want to look for.

To define an event, go to the _Settings_ tab of your [dashboard](https://platform.phospho.ai/).

You can add an the event name and the event description.

You tell phospho what events to look for with natural language in the description of your event. Events are automatically detected by phospho's algorithms.

- As a best practice, you should refere to your user as "the user" and to your LLM app as "the assistant".
- Every time you log an interaction, phospho will detect if an event occured. If an event occured, it will be logged to phospho.

(Optional) You can attach a webhook to the event. Every time the event is detected, phospho will send a POST request to the webhook, with the Event object in the body. Just add your webhook URL in the _Webhook_ field.
