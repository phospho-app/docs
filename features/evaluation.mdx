phospho enables you to evaluate the quality (success or failure) of the interactions between your users and your LLM app.

- By default, phospho **automatically** evaluate the task succes or failure.
- In the webapp, you can **manually** override phospho's annotations 
- To override phospho's annotation at scale, use [the API endpoint](https://api.phospho.ai/v0/redoc#tag/Tasks/operation/post_flag_task_tasks__task_id__flag_post)

Additional annotations enhance the stats and further improve phospho's detection algorithms. 

Results can be seen :

- as aggregated metrics at the project level
- as individual evaluations for each task

## Automatic Evaluation

Every time you log a task, phospho will evaluate the success of the task. To improve the quality of the automatic evaluation, annotate tasks manually in the dashboard.

## Annotate in the phospho webapp

In the phospho dashboard, you can annotate tasks as a success or a failure. Go to the _Sessions_ tab and click on a session. You'll see the list of tasks in the session. Click on a task to annotate it. 
- A thumbs up means that the task was successful. 
- A thumbs down means that the task failed.

Click the thumb to update the evaluation. The button will change to mark that this task was evaluated by a human, and not by phospho.

Add notes and any kind of text with the Notes button next to the thumbs. If there is a note already written, the color of the button changes. 

## Annotate with User feedback

You can gather annotations any way you want. For example, if you have your own tool to collect feedback (such as thumbs up/thumbs down in your chat interface), you can chose to use the phospho API.

Trigger [the API endpoint](https://api.phospho.ai/v0/redoc#tag/Tasks/operation/post_flag_task_tasks__task_id__flag_post) to send your annotations to phospho at scale.

## Visualize the results

Visualize the aggregated results of the evaluations in the _Dashboard_ tab of the phospho webapp.

You can also visualize the results for each task in the _Sessions_ tab. Click on a session to see the list of tasks in the session. A green thumbs up means that the task was successful. A red thumbs down means that the task failed.

If you disagree with the evaluation, you can change it by clicking on the thumbs up or thumbs down. This will be taken into account for the next automatic evaluations.
