## How do you define the success of a task ?

We don't. Our algorithms infer what is a success or a failure for your project based on :
- the user feedback collected by phospho
- the success or failure annotation from you and your team in your dashboard

## Where is stored the data logged to phospho?

The data logged to phospho is stored in a database hosted by Google Cloud on European servers. 

If you wish to self host the phospho backend, contact us at *dev@phospho.app*

## Will the phospho logger impact my app's performances?

No. The phospho logger is designed to use as little resources as possible. The logger runs on a separate, asynchronous thread. All the heavy computation happens asynchronously in the phospho backend. 

## If phospho is down, will my app be down?
phosphor is non-blocking by design. The logger won't raise any Exception in your app if the phospho's servers are unavailable or if you exceeded you quotas.
