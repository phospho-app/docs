<Note>The project is in **Beta**. Expect frequent changes and updates!</Note>

How to get started with phospho:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a phospho account">
    Create an account on [phospho.ai](https://platform.phospho.ai). No credit
    card is required to get started.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Setup phospho logging in your app">
    Start logging using the Python Client, the JavaScript SDK or with the HTTP
    API. It takes on average 5 minutes fo the basic setup.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Visualize your data">
    Get analyses of your user interactions in the phospho dashboard.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 1. Get your phospho API key and your project id

Go to the [phospho platform](https://platform.phospho.ai/). Login or create an account if you don't have one.

If this is your first time using phospho, a Default project has been created for you. On the main page, note down the **project id** and follow the link to create a new **API key**.

If you already have a project, go to Settings. Your project id is displayed on the top of the page. To create an API key, click on the _Manage Organization & API keys_ button. Store your **API key** safely!

## 2. Setup phospho logging in your app

### Add environment variables

In your code, add the following environment variable :

```bash
export PHOSPHO_PROJECT_ID="your_project_id"
export PHOSPHO_API_KEY="your_api_key"
```

### Log to phospho

Logging is how you register tasks to phospho.

**Tasks are the basic bricks that make up your LLM apps.** If you're a programmer, you can think of tasks like functions.

A task is made of at least two things:

- `input (str)`: What goes into a task. Eg: what the user asks to the assistant.
- `output (Optional[str])`: What goes out of the task. Eg: what the assistant replied to the user.

Example of tasks you can log to phospho: _call to an LLM, answering a question, searching in documents, summarizing a text, performing inference of a model, steps of a LLM chain..._

Log tasks using the phospho Python module, the phospho JavaScript/Typescript module, or the API.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Python (recommended)" icon="python">
The phospho [Python module](https://pypi.org/project/phospho/) in the easiest way to log to phospho. It is compatible with Python 3.9+.

```bash
pip install --upgrade phospho
```

To log tasks, use `phospho.log`. The logged tasks are analyzed by the phospho analytics pipeline.

```python
import phospho

# By default, phospho reads the PHOSPHO_PROJECT_ID and PHOSPHO_API_KEY from the environment variables
phospho.init()

# Example
input = "Hello! This is what the user asked to the system"
output = "This is the response showed to the user by the app."

# This is how you log a task to phospho
phospho.log(input=input, output=output)
```

<Tab title="Javascript/Typescript" icon="js">

The phospho [JavaScript module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/phospho) is the easiest way to log to phospho. It is compatible with Node.js.

Types are available for your Typescript codebase.

```bash
npm i phospho
```

To log tasks, use `phospho.log`. The logged tasks are analyzed by the phospho analytics pipeline.

```js
import { phospho } from "phospho";

// By default, phospho reads the PHOSPHO_PROJECT_ID and PHOSPHO_API_KEY from the environment variables
phospho.init();

// Example
const input = "Hello! This is what the user asked to the system";
const output = "This is the response showed to the user by the app.";

// This is how you log a task to phospho
phospho.log({ input, output });
```

<Tab title="API" icon="webhook">

You can directly log to phospho using [the /log endpoint](https://api.phospho.ai/v2/redoc#tag/Logs) of the API.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.phospho.ai/v2/log/$PHOSPHO_PROJECT_ID \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $PHOSPHO_API_KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "batched_log_events": [
        {
            "input": "your_input",
            "output": "your_output"
        }
    ]
}'
```
