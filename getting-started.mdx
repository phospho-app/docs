## 1. Signing up

Go to the [phospho platform](https://platform.phospho.ai/). Login or create an account if you don't have one.

We recommend you to use your company email address to create an account. This will allow you to easily invite your team members to collaborate on the same project.

## 2. Import your first messages

There is several ways to import your data to phospho. The easiest way is by uploading a csv file.

### Format your file

Your CSV or Excel file need to have the following columns:

- `input` : the input text data, ususally the user message
- `output` : the output text, ususally the LLM app response

Additonally, you can add the following columns:

- `task_id`: an id of the task (input/output couple)
- `session_id`: an id of the session. Messages with the same session_id will be grouped together in a single session
- `created_at`: the creation date of the task (format it like `"2021-09-01 12:00:00"`)

The maximum upload size with this method is 500MB.

### Upload your file to the plateform

Click the setting icon at the top right of the screen and select `Import data`.

Then click, the **Upload dataset** button and use **Choose file** button to select your file. Select your csv file and click on the **Send file** button.

Your tasks will be populated in your project in a minute. You might need to refresh the page to see them.

## 3. Run your first clustering

You need to have a payment method set up to run a clustering. You can add a payment method in the settings page and claim your free credits.

Now that your data is imported, you can run your first clustering. Go to the dashboard and click on the **Clusters** tab.
Click on the `Configure clusters detection`button, change the parameters if needed and click on the `Run cluster analysis` button.
And... that's it! After a few minutes, you will be able to see the clusters of your text messages.

Feel free to try again with different parameters or to click the pickaxe icon to breakdown a cluster into smaller clusters.

Please not that running a clustering will cost you 2 credits per message.
