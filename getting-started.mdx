This guide will help you get started with the hosted version of phospho cloud.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get your phospho API key and your project id">
    Create an account on [phospho.ai](https://platform.phospho.ai).
    <Note>
    Don't want to create an account? Get started with the [local version of phospho](/local/quickstart).
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Setup phospho logging in your app">
    Start logging using the Python Client, the JavaScript SDK or with the HTTP
    API. It takes on average 5 minutes for the basic setup.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get insigths in the dashboard">
    Get analyses of your user interactions, explore the analytics and improve
    your app.
  </Step>
</Steps>



## 1. Get your phospho API key and your project id

Go to the [phospho platform](https://platform.phospho.ai/). Login or create an account if you don't have one.

If this is your first time using phospho, a Default project has been created for you. On the main page, note down the **project id** and follow the link to create a new **API key**.

If you already have a project, go to Settings. Your project id is displayed on the top of the page. To create an API key, click on the _Manage Organization & API keys_ button. Store your **API key** safely!

## 2. Setup phospho logging in your app

### Add environment variables

In your code, add the following environment variables:

```bash
export PHOSPHO_API_KEY="your_api_key"
export PHOSPHO_PROJECT_ID="your_project_id"
```

### Log tasks to phospho

**Tasks are the basic bricks that make up your LLM apps.** If you're a programmer, you can think of tasks like functions.

A task is made of an input and an optional output, ideally readable by a human.

- `input (str)`: What goes into a task. _Eg: what the user asks to the assistant._
- `output (Optional[str])`: What goes out of the task. _Eg: what the assistant replied to the user._

Example of tasks you can log to phospho: _call to an LLM, answering a question, searching in documents, summarizing a text, performing inference of a model, steps of a chain-of-thought..._

Tasks can be grouped into **sessions**. Tasks and Sessions can be attached to **users**.

### How to setup logging?

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Python" icon="python">
The phospho [Python module](https://pypi.org/project/phospho/) in the easiest way to log to phospho. It is compatible with Python 3.9+.

```bash
pip install --upgrade phospho
```

To log tasks, use `phospho.log`. The logged tasks are analyzed by the phospho analytics pipeline.

```python
import phospho

# By default, phospho reads the PHOSPHO_API_KEY and PHOSPHO_PROJECT_ID from the environment variables
phospho.init()

# Example
input = "Hello! This is what the user asked to the system"
output = "This is the response showed to the user by the app."

# This is how you log a task to phospho
phospho.log(
  input=input,
  output=output,
  # Optional: for chats, group tasks together in sessions
  # session_id = "session_1",
  # Optional: attach tasks to users
  # user_id = "user_1",
  # Optional: add metadata to the task
  # metadata = {"system_prompt": "You are a helpful assistant."},
)
```

<Tab title="Javascript/Typescript" icon="js">

The phospho [JavaScript module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/phospho) is the easiest way to log to phospho. It is compatible with Node.js.

Types are available for your Typescript codebase.

```bash
npm i phospho
```

To log tasks, use `phospho.log`. The logged tasks are analyzed by the phospho analytics pipeline.

```js
import { phospho } from "phospho";

// By default, phospho reads the PHOSPHO_API_ID and PHOSPHO_PROJECT_KEY from the environment variables
phospho.init();

// Example
const input = "Hello! This is what the user asked to the system";
const output = "This is the response showed to the user by the app.";

// This is how you log a task to phospho
phospho.log({
  input,
  output,
  // Optional: for chats, group tasks together in sessions
  // session_id: "session_1",
  // Optional: attach tasks to users
  // user_id: "user_1",
  // Optional: add metadata to the task
  // metadata: { system_prompt: "You are a helpful assistant." },
});

<Tab title="API" icon="webhook">

You can directly log to phospho using [the /log endpoint](https://api.phospho.ai/v2/redoc#tag/Logs) of the API.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.phospho.ai/v2/log/$PHOSPHO_PROJECT_ID \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $PHOSPHO_API_KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "batched_log_events": [
        {
            "input": "your_input",
            "output": "your_output"
            "session_id": "session_1",
            "user_id": "user_1",
            "metadata": {"system_prompt": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        }
    ]
}'
```

<Info>The `session_id`, `user_id` and `metadata` fields are **optional.**</Info>

<Tab title="Langchain">

We provide a Langchain callback in our [Python module](https://pypi.org/project/phospho/).

```bash
pip install --upgrade phospho
```

```python
from phospho.integrations import PhosphoLangchainCallbackHandler

chain = ... # Your Langchain agent or chain

chain.invoke(
    "Your chain input",
    # Add the callback handler to the config
    config={"callbacks": [PhosphoLangchainCallbackHandler()]},
)
```
