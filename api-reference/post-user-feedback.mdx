description: Try it below to add a feedback to a message

Typically you would collect user feedback in your app, for example through thumb up/thumb down buttons.
Then post it to phospho using this endpoint.
Don't have logged a message yet? Use the [log messages endpoint](/api-reference/log-messages) first and use the `task_id` you got in the response here.
