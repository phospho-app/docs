You can directly log using the API [with the /log endpoint](https://api.phospho.ai/v2/redoc#tag/Logs).

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.phospho.ai/v2/log/$PHOSPHO_PROJECT_ID \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $PHOSPHO_API_KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "batched_log_events": [
        {
            "input": "your_input",
            "output": "your_output"
        }
    ]
}'
```
