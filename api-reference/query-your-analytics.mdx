title: Query your analytics
description: Easily query analytics from your phospho project
---

This is the main endpoint for querying data from phospho.
It can be used add an analytics dashboard in your product,
query data for further analysis or export to destinations not yet supported by phospho.

Most of the vizualisations in the phospho dashboard are built using this service.

## Using temporal dimensions

The dimensions to group by can be a combination of temporal and non-temporal fields.
If the dimension is `month`, `day`, `hour`, or`minute` the data will be grouped by the corresponding time unit from the `created_at` field.
The time will be formated in UTC time with the corresponding format: `YYYY-MM`fo rmonths, `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm` for minutes,...

## Filtering

You can filter the data by any field in the response. Use MongoDB-like syntax to filter the data.
For instance, to filter the data by a start and end date, we will use the following value for the `filters` field of the request:

```json
// Value of the filters field
// created_at is a UNIX timestamp in seconds
{
  "created_at": {
    "$gte": 1723495581,
    "$lt": 1723495681
  }
}
```

## Nested fields

Nested fields are supported (for example, to call the sub-field `model` of the `metadata` field, use `metadata.model`).
If a nested field is a key in the response, the field name will be `metadata_model` (with the points replaced by underscores).
