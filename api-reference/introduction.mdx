Most phospho features are available through the API. The base URL of the phospho API is `https://api.phospho.ai/v2`.

If you do not want to use the API directly, we provide several SDKs to make it easier to integrate phospho into your products:

- [Python SDK](/integrations/python/logging)
- [JavaScript SDK](/integrations/javascript/logging)
- [Langchain and Langsmith](/integrations/langchain)
- [Langfuse](/import-data/import-langfuse)
- [Supabase](/integrations/supabase)

The API full reference is available [here](https://api.phospho.ai/v2/redoc)

## Dedicated endpoints

Contact us at *contact@phospho.ai* to discuss integrating phospho into your products through dedicated endpoints, allowing seamless, behind-the-scenes functionality for your customers.
