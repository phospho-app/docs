Most phospho features are available through the API. The URL of the phospho API is `https://api.phospho.ai/v2`

[Read the API documentation here!](https://api.phospho.ai/v2/redoc)

For example, this will log a task to phospho:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.phospho.ai/v2/log/$PHOSPHO_PROJECT_ID \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $PHOSPHO_API_KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "batched_log_events": [
        {
            "input": "your_input",
            "output": "your_output"
        }
    ]
}'
```


## User Feedback

In your app, you may have thumbs up and thumbs down next to your chat messages. Using the API, you can directly log them to phospho.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.phospho.ai/v2/tasks/TASK_ID/flag \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $PHOSPHO_API_KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "flag": "success",
    "source": "user"
}'
```

Pass `"flag": "success"` or `"flag": "failure"` to the app.
