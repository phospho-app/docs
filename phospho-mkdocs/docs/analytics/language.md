title: Language Detection
description: "Detect the language of your users"

Detect what language your users are speaking in. This lets you analyze in what language your users are interacting with your assistant, and improve it accordingly. 

Language detection is based on the **user message**, so the interaction below will be flagged as english, despite the assistant answering in French.

|        User       |              Assistant             |
|-------------------|------------------------------------|
| What can you do? | Je ne peux pas r√©pondre en anglais |

The language detection method is based on keywords. If the input is very short, the language detection might not be accurate.

In the Transcripts, you can **filter** by language.
