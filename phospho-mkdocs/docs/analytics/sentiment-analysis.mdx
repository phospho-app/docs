description: "Rate the sentiment of your users"

Detect the sentiment of your users. An automatic sentiment analysis is performed on the **user message**. This lets you know whether your users are happy, sad, or neutral.

The sentiment and its magnitude are score. This corresponds to a **negative or positive sentiment** and how **strong** it is.

We then translate this data into a simple, readable label for you: **Positive, Neutral, Mixed and Negative**.

- **Positive**: The sentiment score is greater than **0.3**
- **Neutral**: The sentiment score is between **-0.3** and **0.3**
- **Mixed**: The sentiment score is between **-0.3** and **0.3** but the magnitude is **greater than 0.6**
- **Negative**: The sentiment score is less than **-0.3**

You can also **filter** your data by sentiment in the Transcripts.
