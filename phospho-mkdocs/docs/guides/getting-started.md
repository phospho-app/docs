## 3. Define and run events in the past

### Using events

Events are the key to getting insights from your data. 

An event is a specific interaction between a user and the system you want to track.

To define an event, go to the **Events** tab in the phospho platform and click on the **Add Event** button.

![Add Event](../images/guides/getting_started/add_event.png)

In this tab you can setup events in natural language, in this image, we have setup an event to detect when the system is unable to answer the user's question.

#### Run events in the past

Once you've defined your events, you can run them on past data.

Click on the Detect events button in the **Events** tab to run an event on your data.

![Detect events](../images/guides/getting_started/detect_events.png)

## 4. That's it, you're all set !

You can now [understand your data](/docs/guides/understand-your-data), analyze it, and get insights on your dashboard.
