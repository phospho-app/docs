## Setup your development

Learn how to update your docs locally and and deploy them to the public.

<Note>The project is in **Beta**. Expect frequent changes and updates!</Note>

You can get started with phospho in minutes :

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an account">
    Create an account on [phospho.ai](https://platform.phospho.ai). No credit card is required to get started.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Integrate phospho">
    Start logging using the Python Client, the JavaScript SDK or with the HTTP API. It takes on average 5 minutes fo the basic setup.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Visualize your data">
    Get analyses of your user interactions in the phospho dashboard.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Setup phospho logging in your app

phospho can be integrated in your app in 3 ways:
- the Python module (recommended) available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/phospho/)
- the JavaScript SDK available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/phospho)
- the HTTP API directly, see the API documentation

### Install phospho Python module

The Python phospho module is the easiest way to get started with logging in phospho.

```bash
pip install --upgrade phospho
```

### Get the phospho API key and your project id

Go to the [phospho platform](https://platform.phospho.ai/) and sign in with the provided credentials.

Go to settings.

Copy the **project id**.

Then, go to _Manage phospho API keys_ and create a new API key. Note down the **API key** created.

### Add environment variables

In your code, add the following environment variable :

```
export PHOSPHO_PROJECT_ID="your_project_id"
export PHOSPHO_API_KEY="your_api_key"
```

## Log the tasks of your LLM app

Once you have set up the Python module, add log statements in your app. The logged tasks are analyzed by the phospho analytics pipeline.

There are 3 ways to log with phospho:

1. Logging text inputs and outputs
2. Logging OpenAI queries and responses
3. Wrapping functions arguments and values

### Logging text inputs and outputs

phospho lets you manually register tasks. A task is made at least of two things:

- `input (str)`: What goes into a task. Eg: what the user asks to the assistant.
- `output (str)`: What goes out of the task. Eg: what the assistant replied to the user.

```python
import phospho

#Â By default, phospho reads the PHOSPHO_PROJECT_ID and PHOSPHO_API_KEY from the environment variables
phospho.init()

# Example
input = "Hello! This is what the user asked to the system"
output = "This is the response showed to the user by the app."

# This is how you log a task to phospho
phospho.log(input=input, output=output)
```

Example of interactions you likely want to log to phospho:

- LLM calls
- Prewritten answers
- Steps of an LLM chain

### Logging OpenAI queries and responses

phospho aims to be battery included. So if you pass something else than a `str` to `phospho.log`, phospho extracts what's usually considered "the input" or "the output".

For example, if you use the OpenAI API:

```python
import openai
import phospho

phospho.init(api_key="phospho-key", project_id="phospho-project-id")
openai_client = openai.OpenAI(api_key="openai-key")

input_prompt = "Explain quantum computers in less than 20 words."

# This is your LLM app code
query = {
    "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
                 {"role": "user", "content": input_prompt},
    ],
    "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
}
response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(**query)

# You can directly pass as dict or a ChatCompletion as input and output
log = phospho.log(input=query, output=response)
print("input:", log["input"])
print("output:", log["output"])
```

Result:

```text
input: Explain quantum computers in less than 20 words.
output: Qubits harness quantum physics for faster, more powerful computation.
```

### Wrapping functions' arguments and values

Decorate functions in Python to log them when they are called. Inputs will be the arguments passed to the function, and outputs will be the function values. If the values are streamed, the output is their concatenation.

```python
@phospho.wrap(stream=True, stop=lambda token: token is None)
def answer(messages: List[Dict[str, str]]) -> Generator[Optional[str], Any, None]:
    streaming_response: Stream[
        ChatCompletionChunk
    ] = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=messages,
        stream=True,
    )
    for response in streaming_response:
        yield response.choices[0].delta.content
```

## Get insights in the dashboard

Phospho extracts insights from the tasks logged. Discover the insights in the [phospho dashboard](https://phospho.ai/).

phospho structure the logs in **tasks** and **sessions**.

A **task** is a single operation made by the user. A task is made of an input and an output. _For example, a user sending a question to ChatGPT and receiving an answer is a task._

A **session** groups multiple tasks that happen in the same context. _For example, multiple messages in the same ChatGPT chat is a session._

**Tasks and Sessions can be more general** than just messages in a chat. For example, a task can be _"Fetch documents in a database"_ for a RAG, and a session can be _"The code completions in a single file"_ for a coding copilot.

### Sessions

When you log, add a `session_id` parameter to group tasks in the same session.

Clicking on a session lets you deep dive into every logged task. You can annotate the tasks with thumbs up or thumbs down.

Sessions also highlights the detected **events**.

### Events

Every task logged to phospho goes through an analytics pipeline. In this pipeline, phospho looks for **events** configured in the project Settings.

By default, phospho look for the following events:

- _question_answering_: The user asks a question
- _thanks_: The user thanks the assistant.
- _toxic_behaviour_: The assistant is being toxic to the user.

Create custom events to discover key talking points in a conversation.

You tell phospho what events to look for with natural language. Events are automatically detected by phospho's algorithms.

Example of events:

- The user is trying to book a flight
- The assistant responded something that could be considered financial advice
- The user thanked the agent for its help

Manage Events in the _Settings_ tab.
