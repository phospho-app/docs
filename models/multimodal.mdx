# Requirements

Create an account on [phospho.ai](https://platform.phospho.ai) and get your API key.
You need to have setup a billing method. You can add a it in the Settings of your dashboard [here](https://platform.phospho.ai/org/settings/billing).

# Sending a request

To send a request, add:

- `text`: your text prompt. For instance: "What is this?"
- `image_url`: either a URL of the image or the base64 encoded image data.
  The `inputs` list must be of lenght 1.

If you pass a URL, make sure it is a generally available image (for instance by passing the link in a Private Navigation window).
To encode an image in base 64, you can use [this website](https://base64.guru/converter/encode/image).
