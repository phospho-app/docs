You can generate embeddings for text using the `intent-embed` model. Intent Embed is a mdoel that generates embeddings for text, specifically to represent the user intent. Potential use cases include:

- User Intent classification
- Intent similarity
- Out of topic exclusion
- Intent clustering and analytics
- And more

Read the technical paper here: [Phospho Intent Embeddings](https://research.phospho.ai/phospho_intent_embed.pdf).

# Requirements

Create an account on [phospho.ai](https://platform.phospho.ai) and get your API key.
You need to have setup a billing method. You can add a it in the Settings of your dashboard [here](https://platform.phospho.ai/org/settings/billing).

# Usage

To send a request, add:

- `text`: The text to embed, usually a user query or message.
- `model`: must be set to `intent-embed`.

Optionally, to link this embedding to one of your projects, you can specify the following optional parameters:

- `project_id`: The project id you want to link this embedding to.

<CodeGroup>

```bash HTTP API

curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://api.phospho.ai/v2/embeddings' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_PHOSPHO_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "input": "Your text to embed here",
  "model": "intent-embed"
}'
```

```python Python
import requests

url = 'https://api.phospho.ai/v2/predict'
headers = {
    'accept': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_PHOSPHO_API_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}
data = {
  "input": "Your text to embed here",
  "model": "intent-embed"
}

response = requests.post(url, json=data, headers=headers)

print(response.json()['embeddings'])

```

</CodeGroup>

You will get a response with the embeddings for the input text. The embeddings are a list of floats.

```json
{
  "id": "b429bea42f21476d8b54244679d5a432",
  "created_at": 1717774563,
  "text": "Where is Nico?",
  "embeddings": [
    -0.04311951,
    -0.018762443,
    0.012137596,
    0.0074640415,
    -0.0021662095,
    ...
    ],
    "model": "intent-embed",
    "org_id": "YOUR_ORG_ID",
    "project_id": null,
    "task_id": null
}
```

These embeddings can stored in vector databases like Pinecone, Milvus, Chroma, Qdrand, etc. for similarity search, clustering, and other analytics.

# Pricing

The pricing is based on the number of tokens in the input text.

**Note:** You need to have a billing method setup to use the model. Acces your [billing portal](https://platform.phospho.ai/org/settings/billing) to add one.

| Model name     | Price per 1M input tokens |
| -------------- | ------------------------- |
| `intent-embed` | $0.5                      |

<Info>
You are billed in \$1 increment.

_Example: if you send 150 images, you will be billed \$2._
