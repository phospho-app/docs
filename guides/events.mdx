title: Events Detection
description: "phospho analyze every interaction to look for events"

## What are events in phospho?

Every task logged to phospho goes through an analytics pipeline. In this pipeline, phospho looks for **events** defined in your project settings.

Events are described in **natural language**. Create events to discover key talking points in a conversation, conversion events, hallucinations... 

When an event is detected, phospho will log it in the task, and you can see it in the dashboard.

Be notified and take action when an event is detected using **webhooks**.

### Example of events

- The user is trying to book a flight
- The user thanked the agent for its help
- The user is asking for a refund
- The user bought a product
- The assistant responded something that could be considered financial advice
- The assistant talked as if he was a customer, and not a support

## Create events

Go to the **Insights/Events** tab of the [phospho dashboard](https://platform.phospho.ai/).

### Event definition

Add the event name and the event description.

The event description is a natural language description of the event. Explain how to detect the event in an interaction as if you were explaining it to a 5 years old or an alien.

In the description, refere to your user as "the user" and to your LLM app as "the assistant".

<Card title="Example of an event description">
  The user is trying to book a flight. The user asked a question about a flight.
  Don't include fight suggestions from the agent if the user didn't ask for it.
</Card>

### Manage events

Manage Events in the **Insights/Events** tab. Click delete to delete an event.

## Webhooks

Add an optional webhook to be notified when an event is detected. Click on **Additional settings** to add the webhook URL and the eventual Authorization header.

### What is a webhook?

Webhooks are automated messages sent from apps when something happens. They have a message (payload) and are sent to a unique URL, which is like an app's phone number or address. 

If you have an LLM app with a backend, you can create webhooks.

### How to use the webhook?

Every time the event is detected, phospho will send a `POST` request to the webhook, with the Event object in the body.

Here is the content of the body:

```json
{
    "id": "xxxxxxxxx", // Unique identifier of the detected event
    "created_at": 13289238198, // Unix timestamp (in seconds)
    "event_name": "privacy_policy", // The name of the event, as written in the dashboard
    "task_id": "xxxxxxx", // The task id where the event was detected
    "session_id": "xxxxxxx", // The session id where the event was detected
    "project_id": "xxxxxxx", // The project id where the event was detected
    "org_id": "xxxxxxx", // The organization id where the event was detected
    "webhook": "https://your-webhook-url.com", // The webhook URL
    "source": "phospho-unknown", // Starts with phospho if detected by phospho
}
```

With the task_id, you can retrieve the task in the [phospho API.](https://api.phospho.ai/v2/redoc#tag/Tasks/operation/get_task_tasks__task_id__get)

### Examples

Use webhooks to send slack notifications, emails, SMS, notifications, UI updates, or to trigger a function in your backend.
