## What are events in phospho?

Every task logged to phospho goes through an analytics pipeline. In this pipeline, phospho looks for **events** that you defined in your project settings.

By default, phospho will look for some events (question_answering, thanks, toxic_behavior). You can delete them and create your own!

Create events to discover key talking points in a conversation, conversion events, hallucinations...

You can be notified everytime the event is detected.

### Example of events

- The user is trying to book a flight
- The user thanked the agent for its help
- The user is asking for a refund
- The user bought a product
- The assistant responded something that could be considered financial advice
- The assistant talked as if he was a customer, and not a support

## Create events

Go to the _Settings_ tab of your [dashboard](https://platform.phospho.ai/).

### Event definition

Add the event name and the event description.

The event description is a natural language description of the event. Explain how to detect the event in an interaction as if you were explaining it to a 5 years old or an alien.

In the description, refere to your user as "the user" and to your LLM app as "the assistant".

<Card title="Example of an event description">
  The user is trying to book a flight. The user asked a question about a flight.
  Don't include fight suggestions from the agent if the user didn't ask for it.
</Card>

## Manage events

Open Settings. At the bottom of the screen, you'll see Events already created. Click delete to delete an event.

## Webhook (optional)

Add a webhook to be notified when an event is detected. This is optional.

Every time the event is detected, phospho will send a POST request to the webhook, with the Event object in the body.

### Example: Slack

For example, you can use the webhook to send a slack message to your team.

1. [Follow this guide to get your slack webhook url](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks)
2. Add the webhook url when creating the event. The URL looks like this: `https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`
