phospho enables you to train and use general or custom models.
For now, only binary classification models are supported (learn [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_classification) what binary classification is).

# Upload a dataset

To train a model, you need to upload a dataset containing text, labels and a label description.

- `text` (str): the text to classify (for example, a user message)
- `label` (bool): True or False accroding to the classification
- `label_description` (str): a few word description of the label when true (for example, "user asking for pricing")
