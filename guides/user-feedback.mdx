description: How to send the user feedback from your app to phospho?
---

In your app, you likely collect feedback from your end-user. For example, as a rating (success/failure), free text (ex: a comment), or other interactions (copy to clipboard, etc.).

You can also log this end user feedback to phospho. This helps improve the quality of the scoring model.

The logged feedback is displayed in the webapp for you to review.

## How to log user feedback?

In your app, you likely collect user feedback **after** having logged a task to phospho. To link the user feedback to the log, phospho needs to know the **task_id**.

## How do I get the task_id?

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Python" icon="python">

phospho keeps tracks of the latest task id used. For simple use cases, you can do:

```python
phospho.user_feedback(
    task_id=phospho.latest_task_id,
    flag="success", # or "failure"
    flag_source="user",
    notes="Some notes (can be None)",
)
```

For more complex use cases, you can get the task_id from the `phospho.log`

```python
logged_content = phospho.log(input="question", output="answer")
task_id = logged_content["task_id"]

# ... later, when you collect feedback

phospho.user_feedback(
    task_id=task_id,
    flag="success",
)
```

You can also entirely manage the task_id yourself.

```python
# Generate a new task_id
task_id = phospho.new_task()

# Pass it to phospho.log to create a task with this id
phospho.log(input="question", output="answer", task_id=task_id)

# Give user feedback
phospho.user_feedback(
    task_id=task_id,
    flag="success"
)
```

<Tab title="Javascript/Typescript" icon="js">

phospho keeps tracks of the latest task id used. For simple use cases, you can do:

```javascript
phospho.userFeedback({
  tastId: phospho.latestTaskId,
  flag: "success", // or "failure"
  flagSource: "user",
  notes: "Some notes (can be None)",
});
```

For more complex use cases, you can get the task_id from the `phospho.log`. Beware ! The task_id is in snake_case.

```javascript
const loggedContent = await phospho.log({
  input: "question",
  output: "answer",
});
// Beware ! The task_id is in snake_case
const taskId = loggedContent.task_id;

// ... later, when you collect feedback

phospho.userFeedback({
  taskId: taskId,
  flag: "success",
});
```

You can also entirely manage the task_id yourself.

```javascript
// Generate a new task_id
const taskId = phospho.newTask();

// Pass it to phospho.log to create a task with this id
phospho.log({ input: "question", output: "answer", taskId: taskId });

// Give user feedback
phospho.userFeedback({
  taskId: taskId,
  flag: "success",
});
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="API" icon="webhook">

If you are using the API directly, you need to manage the task_id by yourself.

Create a task_id by generating a random string hash.

```bash
TASK_ID=$(openssl rand -hex 16)
```

<Warning>If this id is already used, phospho will return an error!</Warning>

Pass this task_id to the `log` endpoint.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.phospho.ai/v2/log/$PHOSPHO_PROJECT_ID \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $PHOSPHO_API_KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "batched_log_events": [
        {
            "input": "your_input",
            "output": "your_output",
            "task_id": "$TASK_ID"
        }
    ]
}'
```

Give user feedback by updating the task associated to this hash.s

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.phospho.ai/v2/tasks/$TASK_ID/ \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $PHOSPHO_API_KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "flag": "success",
    "flag_source": "user"
    "notes": "This is what the user said about this task"
}'
```
