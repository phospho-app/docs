title: User Feedback
description: How to send the user feedback from your app to phospho?
---

Logging user feedback is a crucial part of evaluating an LLM app. Even though user feedback is subjective and biased towards negative, it is a valuable source of information to improve the quality of your app.

Setup user feedback in your app to log the user feedback to phospho, review it in the webapp, improve the automatic evaluations, and make your app better.

## Architecture: what's the task_id?

In your app, you should collect user feedback **after** having logged a task to phospho. Every task logged to phospho is identified by a unique **task_id**. 

For phospho to know what task the user is giving feedback on, you need to keep track of the **task_id**.

There are two ways to manage the task_id: frontend or backend. 

Any way you chose, there are helpers in the phospho package to make it easier.

### Option 1: Task id managed by Frontend

<Steps>
<Step>In your frontend, you generate a task id using UUID V4</Step>
<Step>You pass this task id to your backend. The backend executes the task and log the task to phospho with this task id.</Step>
<Step>In your frontend, you collect user feedback based on this task id.</Step>
</Steps>

### Option 2: Task id managed by Backend

<Steps>
<Step>In your frontend, you ask your backend to execute a task.</Step>
<Step>The backend generates a task id using UUID V4, and logs the task to phospho with this task id.</Step>
<Step>The backend returns the task id to the frontend.</Step>
<Step>In your frontend, you collect user feedback based on this task id.</Step>
</Steps>

## Backend: Log to phospho with a known task_id

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Python" icon="python">

The phospho package provides multiple helpers to manage the task_id.

```python
pip install phospho
```

Make sure you have initialized the phospho package with your project_id and api_key somewhere in your app.

```python
import phospho
phospho.init(project_id="your_project_id", api_key="your_api_key")
```

You can fetch the task_id generated by `phospho.log`:

```python
logged_content = phospho.log(input="question", output="answer")
task_id: str = logged_content["task_id"]
```

To generate a new task_id, you can use the `new_task` function.

```python
task_id: str = phospho.new_task()

# Pass it to phospho.log to create a task with this id
phospho.log(input="question", output="answer", task_id=task_id)
```

To get the latest task_id, you can use the `latest_task_id` variable.

```python
latest_task_id = phospho.latest_task_id
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Javascript/Typescript" icon="js">

The phospho package provides multiple helpers to manage the task_id.

```bash
npm install phospho
```

Make sure you have initialized the phospho package with your project_id and api_key somewhere in your app.

```javascript
import {phospho} from "phospho";
phospho.init({projectId: "your_project_id", apiKey: "your_api_key"});
```

You can fetch the task_id generated by `phospho.log`:

```javascript
const loggedContent = await phospho.log({input: "question", output: "answer"});
const taskId: string = loggedContent.task_id;
```

<Warning>
The task_id from the loggedContent is in snake_case.
</Warning>

To generate a new task_id, you can use the `newTask` function.

```javascript
const taskId = phospho.newTask();

// Pass it to phospho.log to create a task with this id
phospho.log({input: "question", output: "answer", taskId: taskId});
```

To get the latest task_id, you can use the `latestTaskId` variable.

```javascript
const latestTaskId = phospho.latestTaskId;
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="API" icon="webhook">

If you are using the API directly, you need to manage the task_id by yourself.

Create a task_id by generating a random string hash. It needs to be unique for each task. 

```bash
TASK_ID=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
```

<Note>
You have higher chances of winning the lottery than generating the same task_id twice with this method.
</Note>

Pass this task_id to the `log` endpoint.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.phospho.ai/v2/log/$PHOSPHO_PROJECT_ID \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $PHOSPHO_API_KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "batched_log_events": [
        {
            "input": "your_input",
            "output": "your_output",
            "task_id": "$TASK_ID"
        }
    ]
}'
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Frontend: Collect user feedback

Once your backend has executed the task and logged it to phospho with a known **task_id**, send the **task_id** back to your frontend.

In your frontend, using the **task_id**, you can collect user feedback and send it to phospho.

<Tab title="React">

We provide [React components](https://github.com/phospho-app/phospho-ui-react) to kickstart your user feedback collection in your app.

```bash
npm install phospho-ui-react
```

```javascript
import "./App.css";
import { FeedbackDrawer, Feedback } from "phospho-ui-react";
import "phospho-ui-react/dist/index.css";

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        <FeedbackDrawer
          // Get your project_id on phospho
          projectId="..."
          // The task_id logged to phospho. Fetch it from your backend after logging
          taskId="..."
          // Source will be also logged to phospho
          source={"user_feedback"}
          // Customize the drawer
          title="Send Feedback"
          description="Help us improve our product."
          onSubmit={(feedback: Feedback) =>
            console.log("Submitted: ", feedback)
          }
          onClose={(feedback: Feedback) => console.log("Closed: ", feedback)}
        />
      </header>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

<Tab title="Javascript" icon="js">

In the browser, use the `sendUserFeedback` function. This function doesn't need your phospho api key. This is done to avoid leaking your phospho API key. However, this function still requires the `projectId`.

Here is how to use the `sendUserFeedback` function. 

```javascript
import {sendUserFeedback} from "phospho";

// Handle logging in your backend, and send the task_id to the browser
const taskId = await fetch(
  "https://your-backend.com/some-endpoint",
  {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      your: "stuff",
    }),
  }
).then((res) => res.json()).then((data) => data.task_id);

// When you collect feedback, send it to phospho
// For example, when the user clicks on a button
sendUserFeedback({
  projectId: "your_project_id",
  tastId: taskId,
  flag: "success", // or "failure"
  flagSource: "user",
  notes: "Some notes (can be None)",
});
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="API" icon="webhook">

If you are using a different language or a different way to manage the frontend, you can use the API endpoint `tasks/{task-id}/flag` directly.

This endpoint is public. You only need to pass the task_id and project_id. This is done to avoid leaking your phospho API key.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.phospho.ai/v2/tasks/$TASK_ID/flag \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "project_id": "$PHOSPHO_PROJECT_ID",
    "flag": "success",
    "flag_source": "user"
    "notes": "This is what the user said about this task"
}'
```

## Backend: Manage user feedback collection

If you don't want to collect user feedback in the frontend, you can instead create an endpoint in your backend and collect user feedback there.

The phospho python package provides a `user_feedback` function to log user feedback.

```python
# See the previous section to get the task_id
task_id = ...

phospho.user_feedback(
    task_id=task_id,
    flag="success", # or "failure"
    flag_source="user", 
    notes="Some notes (can be None)", # optional
)
