You can try out different versions of your app to see which one performs better.

To do so, add a field `version_id` with the name of your version in the metadata field of the tasks you log to phospho.

<CodeGroup>

```python python
log = phospho.log(
    input="log this",
    output="and that",
    version_id="YOUR_VERSION_ID"
)
```

```javascript javascript
log = phospho.log({
  input: "log this",
  output: "and that",
  version_id:"YOUR_VERSION_ID",
});
```

```bash HTTP API
curl -X POST https://api.phospho.ai/v2/log/$PHOSPHO_PROJECT_ID \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $PHOSPHO_API_KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "batched_log_events": [
        {
            "input": "your_input",
            "output": "your_output"
            "metadata": {
                "version_id": "YOUR_VERSION_ID"
            }
        }
    ]
}'

```
