Evaluate your app's performance before deploying it to production. Test your app offline with historical data or a custom dataset. Discover the testing results in the phospho dashboard.

## Overview

The testing framework supports two types of testing:

- **Backtesting**: Backtesting uses the logged phospho data to evaluate your app's performance. This is great to quickly have representative data to test with.
- **Dataset**: Dataset testing allows testing with a custom dataset, providing more control over input scenarios. It's also useful when you don't have a lot of historical data.

The output of the test is a report in the phospho dashboard. To set up what's in the report, you can specify the metrics you want to evaluate. The two main metrics supported by the module are:

- **Evaluate**: Evaluates the output of the app as success or failure based on the provided inputs (this is the same as [phospho evaluation](/features/evaluation))
- **Compare**: Compares the current output of the app with a reference output

## Getting Started

Testing is meant to feel like running unit tests in your codebase. A good practice is to run the tests before deploying your app to production, for example in the CI/CD pipeline.

<Steps>

<Step>
The easiest way to get started is to use the phospho Python module.

```bash
pip install --upgrade phospho
```
</Step>

<Step>

In your project code repository, create a new file called `phospho_testing.py`. This file will contain the test cases for your app.

</Step>

<Step>


The test cases are defined in `phospho_testing.py` as functions with the `@phospho_test.test` decorator.

```python phospho_testing.py
import phospho
from typing import Dict, List

# Create a new test setup
phospho_test = phospho.PhosphoTest()

# Define the test cases
@phospho_test.test(
    source_loader="backtest",
    source_loader_params={"sample_size": 10},
    metrics=["evaluate", "compare"],
)
def test_my_agent(messages: List[Dict[str, str]]):
    # Here, call your agent
    # new_ouput = call_my_agent(messages)
    # We will just return a str for now
    return "The response from the agent"

# Run the test
phospho_test.run(executor_type="parallel")
```
</Step>

<Step>

Run the tests with the following command:

```bash
python phospho_testing.py
```

</Step>

<Step>
Discover the test report in the Test tab in the [phospho dashboard](https://app.phospho.ai/).

## View the report

The report can be viewed in the phospho dashboard. To view the report, go to the phospho dashboard and click on the `Tests` tab.
