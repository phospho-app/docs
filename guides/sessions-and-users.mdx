title: Sessions and Users
description: "Group tasks together into sessions and attach them to users."
---

A **task** is a single operation made by the user. _For example, a user sending a question to ChatGPT and receiving an answer is a task._

A **session** groups multiple tasks that happen in the same context. _For example, multiple messages in the same ChatGPT chat is a session._

A **user** is the end user of your LLM app. _For example, the human chatting with ChatGPT._

<Info>
**Tasks, sessions and users are just abstractions.** They are meant to help you understand the context of a log. You can use them as you want.

For example, 
- A task can be _"Fetch documents in a database"_ for a RAG.
- A session can be _"The code completions in a single file"_ for a coding copilot.
- A user can be _"The microservice querying the API"_ for a question answering model.

</Info>

## Tasks

A **task** is made of an `input` and an optional `output`, which are text readable by humans. Think of them as the messages in a chat. 

But in addition to the `input` and `output`, you can also pass a `raw_input` and a `raw_output`. Those are the raw data that your LLM app received and produced. They are mostly meant for the developers of your LLM app.

To help you understand the context of a task, you can also pass **metadata** to your tasks. For example, the version of the model used or the time it took to generate the output. They are great to test your LLM app.


<CodeGroup>
```python Python
import phospho

phospho.init()

phospho.log(
    input="What is the meaning of life?",
    output="42",
    #Â Metadata
    raw_input={"chat_history": ...},
    metadata={
        "model_version": "1.0.0",
        "generation_time": 0.1,
    },
)
```

```javascript JavaScript
import { phospho } from "phospho";

phospho.init();

phospho.log({
    input: "What is the meaning of life?",
    output: "42",
    // Metadata
    raw_input={"chat_history": ...},
    metadata={
        "model_version": "1.0.0",
        "generation_time": 0.1,
    },
});
```
</CodeGroup>

Note that the output is optional, but the input is required.

<Info>
A task can be a call to a LLM. But it can also be something completely different. 

For example, a task can be a call to a database, or the result of a complex chain of thought.

By default, when logging, a task id is automatically generated for you. Generating your own task id is useful to attach user feedback later on (on this topic, see [User Feedback](/guides/user-feedback)).

## Sessions

Group tasks together by attaching a **session id** when logging. 

If you're using phospho in a chatbot, we highly recommend to attach a session id to each message. This way, you can group messages together in the same chat. It's easier to read and understand the logs.

The session id can be any string. We recommend, however, to use a UUID generated by a random hash function. We provide a helper function to generate a session id.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
session_id = phospho.new_session()

phospho.log(
    input="What is the meaning of life?",
    output="42",
    session_id=session_id,
)
```

```javascript JavaScript
const sessionId = phospho.newSession();

phospho.log({
    input: "What is the meaning of life?",
    output: "42",
    sessionId: sessionId,
});
```

</CodeGroup>

Sessions are useful for short term ingihts. For example, to monitor for how long a user chats with your LLM app before disconnecting, the average number of messages per session, or what kind of messages ends a session.

## Users

<Tip>Coming soon!</Tip>

Attach tasks and sessions to a **user id** when logging. The user id can be any string. 

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
phospho.log(
    input="What is the meaning of life?",
    output="42",
    user_id="user_1",
)
```

```javascript JavaScript
phospho.log({
    input: "What is the meaning of life?",
    output: "42",
    userId: "user_1",
});
```
</CodeGroup>

Users are useful to understand how someone use your LLM app on the long run. For example, to monitor the retention of your users.
