title: Sessions and Users
description: "Group tasks together into sessions."
---

A **task** is a single operation made by the user. A task is made of an input and an output. _For example, a user sending a question to ChatGPT and receiving an answer is a task._

A **session** groups multiple tasks that happen in the same context. _For example, multiple messages in the same ChatGPT chat is a session._

**Tasks and Sessions can be more general** than just messages in a chat. For example, a task can be _"Fetch documents in a database"_ for a RAG, and a session can be _"The code completions in a single file"_ for a coding copilot.
