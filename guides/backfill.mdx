title: Backfill Historical Data
description: "You can upload historical data to phospho to backfill your logs."
---

phospho supports backfilling of transcripts from files or other data sources. To backfill your data, create a script to iterate over your tasks, and upload them to phospho using the HTTP API. Keep the batch size to a reasonable limit to avoid timeouts (a thousand items).

This method support all the features of the usual log API, such as the ability to add metadata to the tasks.

### Sample code

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
import phospho
from phospho.models import Task

# Your project ID
project_id = "your_project_id"
org_id = "your_org_id"

# You need to have the PHOSPHO_API_KEY and PHOSPHO_PROJECT_ID environment variables set
# Otherwise, you can set them as parameters to the init function
phospho.init()

phospho.backfill(
    [
        Task(
            project_id=project_id,
            org_id=org_id,
            input="First batch input",
            output="First batch output",
        ),
        Task(
            project_id=project_id,
            org_id=org_id,
            input="Second batch input",
            output="Second batch output",
            metadata={"key": "value"},
        ),
    ]
)

```

```bash HTTP API
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://api.phospho.ai/v2/backfill/$PHOSPHO_PROJECT_ID' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer $PHOSPHO_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "created_at": 1713342083,
      "org_id": $PHOSPHO_ORG_ID,
      "project_id": $PHOSPHO_PROJECT_ID,
      "input": "Here is the text of the input",
      "output": "Here is the text of the output"
    }
  ]
}'
```

```javascript JS
// Comming soon
```
