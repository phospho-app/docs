title: Language Detection
description: "What language is your user speaking?"
---

We noticed people wanted to know the language their users were speaking. 
So we added a feature to detect the input language.

Note that this feature focuses on the **input** of a task, so the task below will be flagged as english, despite the assistant answering in French.

|        User       |              Assistant             |
|-------------------|------------------------------------|
| What can you do ? | Je ne peux pas r√©pondre en anglais |

Also, the language detection method is based on keywords so if the input is very short, the language might be misidentified.

You can also **filter** your tasks by language in the task list.
