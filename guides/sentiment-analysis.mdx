We noticed people wanted to leverage sentiment analysis. 

Your tasks will now be **analyzed for sentiment**.

We score the sentiment and its magnitude. This corresponds to a **negative or positive sentiment** and how **strong** it is.

We then translate this data into a readable label for you: **Positive, Neutral, Mixed and Negative**.

- **Positive**: The sentiment score is greater than **0.3**
- **Neutral**: The sentiment score is between **-0.3** and **0.3**
- **Mixed**: The sentiment score is between **-0.3** and **0.3** but the magnitude is **greater than 0.6**
- **Negative**: The sentiment score is less than **-0.3**

You can also **filter** your tasks by sentiment in the task list.
