phospho automatically detects conversations topics using semantic matching, giving you visibility into how users are engaging with your product.

To discover what are the topics , go to the **Topics** section in the left menu of your dashboard.

For example, to the question `" Will it be raining today?"`, phospho will detect the topic `"Weather"`.
