You can then click on import data.

![Click on settings](../images/guides/getting_started/settings.png)

You now have different options, the easiest options are to import from a CSV/Excel file or to synchronise with LangSmith if you have existing data there.

For other options, you can take a look at the [technical documentation](/getting-started) to import data directly from your system.

#### Import from a CSV file

You can import a CSV/Excel file with the following format:

```csv
input,output,task_id,session_id,created_at
"Hello! This is what the user asked to the system","This is the response showed to the user by the app.","task_1","session_1","2024-05-31 12:31:22"
```

<Info>
- Make sure that your CSV is a valid CSV file separated by a comma. 
- Make sure the created_at field is in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`.
</Info>

#### Import from LangSmith

You can import existing data from [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com) by providing the LangSmith API key and your LangSmith project name.

We will periodically fetch your data from LangSmith and import it into phospho.

<Note>
This data is encrypted and stored securely. We need it to periodically fetch your data from LangSmith and import it into phospho.
</Note>

## 3. Define and run events in the past

### Using events

Events are the key to getting insights from your data. 

An event is a specific interaction between a user and the system you want to track.

To define an event, go to the **Events** tab in the phospho platform and click on the **Add Event** button.

![Add Event](../images/guides/getting_started/add_event.png)

In this tab you can setup events in natural language, in this image, we have setup an event to detect when the system is unable to answer the user's question.

#### Run events in the past

Once you've defined your events, you can run them on past data.

Click on the Detect events button in the **Events** tab to run an event on your data.
