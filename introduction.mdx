[phospho](https://phospho.ai/) is a platform to analyse interactions between your LLM app and your users, at the product level.

- log every text interaction your LLM app
- run automatic evaluations to measure success and detect events
- conduct experiments and test your LLM app
- understand what are your users doing and how to improve your app

## How does it work?

1. **Log the tasks** completed by your LLM app (ex: _what was the question asked by the user, and what answer of the assistant_)
2. Configure the analytics pipeline to **run evaluations** on transcripts (ex: _detect when the assistant couldn't answer the user's question_)
3. Explore your LLM app evaluations on the **phospho dashboard** 

## Key features

- Visualize analytics in a dashboard
- Deep-dive in tasks and sessions
- Automatically and manually annotate successful tasks 
- Automatically detect events
- Manage projects and conduct A/B tests
- (Coming soon) Backtest on past logs
